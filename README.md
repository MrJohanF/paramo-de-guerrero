## Setup Instructions

### Clone the Repository

```
git clone https://github.com/MrJohanF/docker-phpmyadmin-ready-to-use.git
```
```
cd docker-phpmyadmin-ready-to-use
```

### Create Database Credentials

Create a folder named `db/` in the root of the project. Inside this folder, create a file named `password.txt` and put your MySQL database password in it.

### Configure Database 

Update the `compose.yaml` file to match your database configuration. Make sure to change the database name, user, and password as needed.

### Build and Start Containers

```
docker-compose up --build
```

### Grant Privileges

After the containers are up, run the following command to access the MySQL container and grant privileges to the user:

```
docker-compose exec db mysql -u root -p
```

Once in the MySQL prompt, run the following SQL commands to grant privileges and flush them:

```
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'your_user'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'your_password';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```
